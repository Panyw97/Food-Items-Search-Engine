Note on the Rubric 
------------------
Professor Ferrari and Samuels conferred on all projects before assigning a final project grade to each one. Although some of the grading criteria may appear subjective to you, we were as objective as possible and assigned almost all grades using checkpoints on the essential parts that we required for the project. 

The soft criterium we used is mostly concentrated on items #2 (Data Analysis) and #3 (Scope and Complexity). The final grade for those items resulted from Instructors' joint evaluation of all the projects as a whole. We are also rewarding in those rubrics team's effort and dedication. We consider a project more complex if it required different types of skills and used more diverse content we covered in during the quarter (e.g., if the team donwloaded and used two ready-to-use data sets VS if the data was constructed using complex webscraping, data cleaning, record linkage, and everything were stored in a relational SQL database).

Please note that these grades are final! We will not make any grade adjustments unless it is due to an arithmetic error. 

As with assignments, feel free to reach out if you do have any questions about improvement or clarification. Please respond via email if you do have any questions (not on piazza). With moving to remote learning for the spring, We will be busy preparing for the next quarter, so we may not have a chance to respond right away.

Comments: >

You developed a reasonably complex project, and used various topics we covered during this and previous quarter, including web-scraping, SQL, data cleaning, classes, and you went beyond, using front end application. Great work on that part!

In terms of coding style, you didn't complete the docstring of many functions and methods. You also exceeded 80 char line limits in some scripts. Additionally, you used many contants (tj_prod.columns in DataCleaning.py, to mention one). Constants by convention of good coding style are named with uppercase letters, and all put at the top of the script after you import the modules. You did that in some scripts, but not in others.


Unfortunately, the main issue is that I could not run your code. Some of the verions of the packages in your requirements.txt were not available on pypi and the application Front end didn't work. That is why I am discounting points for visualization and design. I got this error:
